# GPSCDF: Generalized Propensity Score Cumulative Distribution Function

Implements the generalized propensity score cumulative distribution
function (GPS-CDF) proposed by Greene (2017) <https://digitalcommons.library.tmc.edu/dissertations/AAI10681743/>. A single scalar balancing score is calculated for any generalized propensity score vector with three or more treatments. This balancing score is used for propensity score matching and stratification in outcome analyses when analyzing either ordinal or multinomial treatments.
